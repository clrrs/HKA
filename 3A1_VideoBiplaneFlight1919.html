        <p tabindex="0">In this clip from her 1919 silent movie “Deliverance,” Helen puts on a leather
             flight jacket and crash helmet, and rides in the open cockpit of a biplane. Anne Sullivan 
             and Polly Thomson help Helen gear up.  Helen’s brother Phillips Brooks Keller, an Army 
             pilot in WWI, keeps a watchful eye on his sister during her flight.

            Grainy black and white film shows Helen preparing her leather flight jacket and helmet.  
            Anne Sullivan and Polly Thomson assist, while Helen's mother and brother watch.  
            Her brother wears the uniform of a US Army WWI aviator.  
            Anne and Polly help Helen board the open front cockpit of a biplane, 
            while the pilot sits in the rear cockpit.  Groundcrew spins the propeller to start the engine,
             and the biplane makes a wobbly takeoff from a dusty field.   
             The biplane is shown high in the sky, followed by a shot of her friends and family watching.  
             A closeup from the side, likely filmed while the plane was on ground, plays to illustrate her flight. 
              A smooth landing on grass is shown,
             and then Helen is assisted out of the biplane, and she gives Anne a hug.   </p>
