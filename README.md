# HKA

Helen Keller Archive

> **Note:** This is a demo/prototyping version. Installation and update processes described here are for testing purposes and will change for the final release.

## For Solid Light/WET: Installing the Windows App

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/clrrs/HKA/releases/latest)
2. Download the `.exe` file (e.g. `HKA-Kiosk-Setup-1.0.0.exe`)
3. Run the installer. It will install and launch the app

### NVDA (Screen Reader)

[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) must be installed and running **before** the app launches. The app uses `role="application"` to put NVDA into focus mode, which only works if NVDA is already active at page load.

For kiosk deployment, configure NVDA to start automatically:
NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > General > **"Start NVDA after I sign in"**

A pre-configured NVDA settings file will be added to this repo in the future.
