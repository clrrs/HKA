            <p tabindex="0">In response to the Nazi regime's persecution of religious minorities, particularly Jews,
                Keller's words stood as a bold indictment of these atrocities. She wrote, "Do not imagine your
                barbarities to the Jews are unknown here. God sleepeth not, and He will visit His Judgment upon you."
                This powerful statement reflects Keller's deep commitment to religious freedom and her recognition of
                the intrinsic value of every human being, irrespective of their religious beliefs.

                Keller's advocacy, rooted in her own experiences of overcoming societal barriers as a deafblind woman,
                lent a unique voice to the discourse on religious tolerance. Her letter not only condemned the Nazi
                regime's actions but also served as a rallying cry for justice and humanity.
