            Helen Keller, responding to the Nazi persecution of Jews, issued a stern warning against their atrocities,
            stating, "Do not imagine your barbarities to the Jews are unknown here. God sleepeth not, and He will visit
            His Judgment upon you." This declaration showcased Keller's commitment to religious freedom and the value of
            every individual, regardless of faith. Drawing from her own journey as a deafblind woman overcoming societal
            obstacles, Keller's advocacy for religious tolerance condemned the Nazi actions and called for justice and
            humanity, adding a powerful voice to the discourse.
