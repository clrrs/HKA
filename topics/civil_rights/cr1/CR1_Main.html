    <p tabindex="0">
        As totalitarianism took hold of Germany in the nineteen thirties, the Nazi regime's book burnings symbolized a
        brutal repression of
        culture. Helen Keller responded with conviction, asserting that despite being burned, the ideas within books
        would survive and continue to inspire others. "You can burn my books and the books of the best minds in
        Europe, but the ideas in them have seeped through a million channels, and will continue to quicken other
        minds." Her letter was a testament to the immortality of ideas, standing as a beacon of hope and resistance
        against tyranny.
