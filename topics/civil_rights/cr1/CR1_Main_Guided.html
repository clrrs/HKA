        <p tabindex="0">
            This yellowed, letter-size page features the typewritten words of Helen Keller and penciled corrections,
            edits, and margin notes. The two fold-creased lines across the letter as well as darkened, aged spots on the
            top right and middle left of the sheet indicate various degrees of handling and use. The letters margins are
            generous, with a top and side margins with room to write—the typewritten content comprises slightly more
            than half of the page’s length. A faint watermark is visible in two locations on the page indicating
            “Milford Bond, U.S.A., Reg Content.”

            The top margin of the letter features several handwritten elements. The top-right margin features the date,
            “May 9, 1933” written in cursive pencil. The left corner of the page features the written “Cablegram to” in
            cursive pencil writing. Interestingly, the letter was typed with “Adolf Hitler, Berlin, Germany,” but this
            addressee is scribbled over with several pencil lines. Above this marked-out addressee an arrow is drawn
            pointing to the top of the letter’s margin, where a new addressee is written in pencil, “To the Student body
            of Germany.”

            The letter’s three-paragraphed, seven-sentenced structure feature several other edits. The middle sentence
            features a penciled-over mark on the word “right” and written above in pencil “royalties.” The end of this
            middle sentence features a handwritten addition of “for the German people.” This sentence reads; “I gave all
            the royalties [rights] of my books to the soldiers blinded in the World War with no thought in my heart but
            love and compassion [for the German people].

            To the right of this sentence, in the margin of the letter, a phrase “fall ruin” is handwritten in cursive
            pencil, but this phrase does not appear to have been incorporated into the letter.

            In the closing three sentences of the letter, a large portion of the middle sentence is scribbled through in
            back-and-forth pencil markings. The sentence begins, “God sleepeth not, and He will visit His Judgement upon
            you.” The remainder of the sentence is scribbled over; it reads, “as surely as upon the wicked kings of
            Judea who defied his word.”

            On the lower portion of the sheet, a final phrase is written in cursive pencil, across four lines, “I
            acknowledged the previous [completion] that have led to your intolerance.  All the more do I deplore the
            injustice + the wisdom of passing out to [indecipherable] of your deeds.”

            On the reverse side of the letter, presumably the intended recipient, is written in pencil on three lines;
            “Carl Schurz Foundation,” “Berling,” “Gerein studenten.”
