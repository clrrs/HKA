            Imagine a tangible piece of history before you: a letter from Helen Keller, dated May 9, 1933, addressed to
            the student body of Germany and Adolf Hitler. This document is a testament to Keller's boldness and her
            stand against injustice.

            The single-page letter has a distinct historical aura. Keller would have dictated the content of the letter
            for an interpreter to scribe. It is written using a typewriter, with corrections and notes added over top in
            pencil. The paper has aged over the decades, taking on a yellowed hue, and it bears the marks of being
            folded– perhaps multiple times. These physical signs of age add a layer of materiality and gravity to the
            document.

            The body of the letter is striking in its clarity and conviction. Amidst the typed text, certain words and
            phrases have been crossed out and corrected. These revisions reveal the thoughtful process behind Keller’s
            message, possibly reflecting a determination to express her thoughts precisely.

            One section is notably changed in pencil: the recipient. “Adolf Hitler, Berlin, Germany” is crossed out, and
            replaced with “To the Student Body of Germany.” This change in the intended recipient of the letter speaks
            volumes, indicating a decision to address the youth of Germany directly.

            Keller's words are powerful and direct. She condemns the burning of books and the persecution of the Jews
            under Hitler's regime, stating boldly, "History has taught you nothing if you think you can kill ideas."

            Keller later follows with another warning: “God sleepeth not, and He will visit His Judgment upon you.” This
            invocation of divine judgment is not just a religious assertion, but serves as a powerful metaphor for the
            inevitable retribution of the Nazi’s transgressions against mankind. This line, embedded in the midst of her
            letter, is a reminder of the universal values of justice and human dignity, that will outlast, and stand in
            stark opposition to, oppression and violence.

            The artifact of Helen Keller’s letter to the youth of Germany, with its evidence of Keller’s thought
            process, its physical signs of age, and its powerful, timeless ideas, stands as a poignant testament to the
            courage and moral clarity required to challenge injustice.
