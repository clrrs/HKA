            [strikethrough: Adolf Hitler, Berlin, Germany.] <br> <br>

            History has taught you nothing if you think you can kill ideas. Tyrants have tried to do
            that often before,
            and the ideas have risen up in their might and destroyed them.
            You can burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, but the ideas in them
            have seeped through a
            million channels, and will continue to quicken other minds. I gave all the royalties
            [strikethrough: rights]
            of my books for all time to the soldiers blinded in the World War with no thought in my
            heart but love and
            compassion for the German people.
            Do not imagine your barbarities to the Jews are unknown here. God sleepeth not, and He
            will visit His
            Judgment upon you [strikethrough: as surely as upon the wicked kings of Judea who defied
            His Word]. Better
            were it for you to have a mill-stone hung round your neck and sink into the sea than to
            be hated and
            despised of all men.
            Helen Keller

            [handwritten: I acknowledged the previous [completion] that have led to your
            intolerance. All the more do I
            deplore the injustice + the wisdom of passing out to [indecipherable] of your deeds.
