        <h2 tabindex="0">Freedom Taking Flight</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">In the 1910s, amidst the Woman’s Suffrage movement for equal rights in the U.S., Helen
                Keller emerged as a key figure in the fight for gender equality, demonstrating that women are capable of
                anything. Challenging the era's sexist and ableist views, Keller, a deafblind woman, defied the notion
                that she couldn't enjoy air travel, a novelty at the time. Her first flight in 1918 left her thrilled
                and exhilarated, symbolizing her freedom and defiance of gender norms. This act of spirited disobedience
                mirrored the broader struggle for women's rights, contributing to the eventual success of the Women’s
                Suffrage movement.
