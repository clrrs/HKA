        <h2 tabindex="0">Freedom Taking Flight</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">In the 1910’s, women in the United States were fighting against gender discrimination,
                demanding
                equal
                representation through the Woman’s Suffrage movement.

                It was during this time that Helen Keller would soar far above discriminatory labels to become a
                prominent
                figure in the battle for gender equality, proving to the world that women can do anything.

                In an era when air travel was a novelty, and women– especially those with disabilities– seldom traveled,
                Helen Keller challenged the sexist and ableist misconception that a deafblind woman couldn’t fly, let
                alone
                enjoy the experience. Helen, describing her first flight in 1918, wrote: "I was thrilled, excited,
                happy!
                Never in my life had I felt such a sense of freedom..."

                Smiling, fearless, and determined, the video of Helen’s first flight embodies the spirited disobedience
                against gender norms that would eventually lead to the victory of the Women’s Suffrage movement two
                years
                later.
