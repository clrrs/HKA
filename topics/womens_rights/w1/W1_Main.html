        <h2 tabindex="0">Freedom Taking Flight</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">In the 1910s, amidst the Woman’s Suffrage movement for equal rights in the U.S., Helen
                Keller emerged as a key figure in the fight for gender equality, demonstrating that women are capable of
                anything. Challenging the era's sexist and ableist views, Keller, a deafblind woman, defied the notion
                that she couldn't enjoy air travel, a novelty at the time. Her first flight in 1918 left her thrilled
                and exhilarated, symbolizing her freedom and defiance of gender norms. This act of spirited disobedience
                mirrored the broader struggle for women's rights, contributing to the eventual success of the Women’s
                Suffrage movement.

        <p tabindex="0">
            Female narrator: It showed her first airplane ride. A daring feat at that time.
            Male audio description: In old, black and white footage, elegantly-dressed women help
            tidy Helen’s leather
            coat.
            [engine rumbles]
            Male audio description: She also wears a tight leather helmet on her head. An airplane
            drives across a field
            and takes off into the air. On the ground, Helen’s friends watch excitedly as the plane
            flies high in the
            sky.
            [uplifting orchestral music]
            Male audio description: Helen rides in the front and a pilot steers in the back of the
            two-seater aircraft.
            Wind flies over their heads in the open, roofless plane. The airplane safely lands on
            the flat, grassy
            ground. Dozens of people rush to the parked plane and assist Helen out of the sunken
            seat. Helen smiles broadly and hugs her teacher Anne Sullivan Macy. </p>
