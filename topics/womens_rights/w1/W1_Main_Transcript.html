            Female narrator: It showed her first airplane ride. A daring feat at that time.
            Male audio description: In old, black and white footage, elegantly-dressed women help
            tidy Helen’s leather
            coat.
            [engine rumbles]
            Male audio description: She also wears a tight leather helmet on her head. An airplane
            drives across a field
            and takes off into the air. On the ground, Helen’s friends watch excitedly as the plane
            flies high in the
            sky.
            [uplifting orchestral music]
            Male audio description: Helen rides in the front and a pilot steers in the back of the
            two-seater aircraft.
            Wind flies over their heads in the open, roofless plane. The airplane safely lands on
            the flat, grassy
            ground. Dozens of people rush to the parked plane and assist Helen out of the sunken
            seat. Helen smiles
            broadly and hugs her teacher Anne Sullivan Macy.

        <h2 tabindex="0">Freedom Taking Flight
            </h3>
            <p tabindex="0">In the 1910’s, women in the United States were fighting against gender
                discrimination,
                demanding
                equal
                representation through the Woman’s Suffrage movement.

                It was during this time that Helen Keller would soar far above discriminatory labels
                to become a
                prominent
                figure in the battle for gender equality, proving to the world that women can do
                anything.

                In an era when air travel was a novelty, and women– especially those with
                disabilities– seldom traveled,
                Helen Keller challenged the sexist and ableist misconception that a deafblind woman
                couldn’t fly, let
                alone
                enjoy the experience. Helen, describing her first flight in 1918, wrote: "I was
                thrilled, excited,
                happy!
                Never in my life had I felt such a sense of freedom..."

                Smiling, fearless, and determined, the video of Helen’s first flight embodies the
                spirited disobedience
                against gender norms that would eventually lead to the victory of the Women’s
                Suffrage movement two
                years
                later.
