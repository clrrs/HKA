            Female narrator: It showed her first airplane ride. A daring feat at that time.
            Male audio description: In old, black and white footage, elegantly-dressed women help
            tidy Helen’s leather
            coat.
            [engine rumbles]
            Male audio description: She also wears a tight leather helmet on her head. An airplane
            drives across a field
            and takes off into the air. On the ground, Helen’s friends watch excitedly as the plane
            flies high in the
            sky.
            [uplifting orchestral music]
            Male audio description: Helen rides in the front and a pilot steers in the back of the
            two-seater aircraft.
            Wind flies over their heads in the open, roofless plane. The airplane safely lands on
            the flat, grassy
            ground. Dozens of people rush to the parked plane and assist Helen out of the sunken
            seat. Helen smiles
            broadly and hugs her teacher Anne Sullivan Macy.
