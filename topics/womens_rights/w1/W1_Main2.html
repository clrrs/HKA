            <p tabindex="0">Helen Keller resisted definition throughout her life– not only was she a
                champion for
                Disability Rights, but also a fervent advocate of Women’s Suffrage. Keller was an
                active figure in the
                Suffragist movement, delivering speeches, writing to political leaders, and
                participating in suffragist
                rallies.

                Keller faced criticism for her beliefs on women’s suffrage, much like other
                outspoken women of her time.
                Critics would often dismiss her political opinions, and wrongly alleged that they
                were not her own, but
                those of her close acquaintances.

                Despite efforts to diminish her political strength and to silence her voice, Helen
                persisted in her
                fearless advocacy for women’s rights.
                <br><br>

                “Today, women are asserting their rights; tomorrow, nobody will be foolhardy enough
                to question them.”
                From Helen Keller’s 1920 speech, "Why Woman Wants to Vote.”
