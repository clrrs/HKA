        <h2 tabindex="0">The Woman's Suffrage Movement</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">Throughout her life, Helen Keller defied categorization, actively championing both
                Disability Rights and Women's Suffrage. She was deeply involved in the Suffragist movement, delivering
                speeches, engaging with political leaders, and attending rallies. Despite facing criticism and attempts
                to undermine her autonomy by suggesting her ideas were not her own, Keller's commitment to advocating
                for women's rights never wavered. Her persistence and fearless advocacy were encapsulated in her 1920
                speech, "Why Woman Wants to Vote," where she confidently stated, “Today, women are asserting their
                rights; tomorrow, nobody will be foolhardy enough to question them.”
